# Candle LED

> Hardware and software design for a ATTiny85 based LED candle effect.
> Based on [this post](https://www.nzbuilds.com/post/how-to-build-a-candle-light-led-lamp-flame-effect-with-arduino-micro), information found on [Ohmify]() and this avrlibc [example](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html)

## TODO

- [ ] Check howto do basic HC-05 controlled LED.
- [ ] Check ISP wiring, does it need protective/isolating R's?
- [ ] Control Hub based on Nerves for multiple lamps/single control point.
